    "# Climate Wine Project – Spatial Analysis of Wine Production in Alentejo\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This notebook defines the scope of the spatial analysis project of wine production in Alentejo, Portugal. \n",
    "The goal is to investigate how climatic variables (annual mean temperature and precipitation) influence wine production, identify spatial patterns,\n",
    "and detect potential areas of risk or opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Main Question\n",
    "**How do climatic variables (annual mean temperature and precipitation) influence wine production by municipality in Alentejo?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Sub-Questions\n",
    "1. **Which municipalities have the highest productivity, and how does this relate to climate?**  \n",
    "   - Deliverable: map of wine production per municipality with climate overlays.\n",
    "2. **Where are there areas of high production under high climatic stress?**  \n",
    "   - Deliverable: hotspot maps showing production in regions with climatic stress.\n",
    "3. **Are there clear spatial patterns in production distribution (high or low production clusters)?**  \n",
    "   - Deliverable: spatial cluster analysis using QGIS and Python (geopandas, rasterio, matplotlib).\n",
    "4. **How does climate variability over the years affect average production per municipality?**  \n",
    "   - Deliverable: time series graphs, trend analysis, and temporal correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Objectives\n",
    "- Demonstrate integration of **spatial analysis and statistics**.  \n",
    "- Apply **Python (pandas, geopandas, rasterio, matplotlib, seaborn)** and **QGIS** for georeferenced data analysis.  \n",
    "- Produce **clear visualizations** to interpret patterns and risks in viticultural production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Deliverables\n",
    "- File: `notebooks/00_scope.ipynb` → questions, scope, and analysis plan.  \n",
    "- Maps, graphs, and statistical analyses addressing each sub-question.  \n",
    "- Organized dataset for future analyses (CSV, shapefiles, raster).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Tools\n",
    "- **QGIS**: visualization and spatial analysis.  \n",
    "- **Python**: pandas, geopandas, rasterio, matplotlib, seaborn.  \n",
    "- **Git/GitHub**: version control and online portfolio.\n"
